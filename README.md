# MRI-based-Predicted-Transformer-for-Prostate-cancer
An MRI-pathology model (MRI-based Predicted Transformer for Prostate cancer (MRI-PTPCa)) was proposed to discover correlations between mp-MRI and tumor regressiveness of PCa and was further deployed for diagnosing non-PCa, PCa, non-CSPCa, CSPCa, and grading of GGG
